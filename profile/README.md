# Matr Clock
The open source, hackable, synchronized, self-hosted, multi-purpose, forever clock. 

The Matr client is wafer thin, requiring only the ability to display an animated gif. 
The Matr server is nearly as simply, requiring only a gif be served. Other features are optional, but strictly so. B client and server are easy to implement, reimplement, extend and hack.
