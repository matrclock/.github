# Matr Clock
The open source, hackable, synchronized, self-hosted, multi-purpose, forever clock. 

Matr clocks works on a single server supplying one or more clients. While the original Matr clock is based on a slick LED RGB matrix display, there is no requirement that any given Matr clock be based on anything other than the ability to display a gif. The server simply serves a gif. The client simply displays it.
